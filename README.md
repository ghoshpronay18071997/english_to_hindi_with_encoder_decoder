# **1. Project Description**

- **Natural Language Processing** in **Artificial Intelligence** is the application of computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural language and speech.

- In this project the objective is **to deliver the hindi translation of the english text** that has been given in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/aiswaryaramachandran/hindienglish-corpora">dataset</a>.

- For a hypothetical scenario it has been assumed one is working as a **NLP Engineer** in a technical start-up who have onboarded this project from one of their clients.

- The objective is to deliver the **Best fit model** as per the project deliverables are concerned.

- The prime **Business Constraint** is to deliver **Quality** in terms of making this case study.

- The evaluation metric for this problem statement is set as **Accuracy.**

# **3. Approach towards the problem**

- The approach in this case study was to make a machine learning model that can **predict the hindi words translation** from a **given english sentence.**

- Initially, libraries were installed and upgraded.

- Followed by that it was found that the dataset has  
  - **50,000 source** datapoints **tides** categorized as **tides**.
  - **39,881 source** datapoints **tides** categorized as **ted**.
  - **37,726 source** datapoints **tides** categorized as **indic2012**
  
- It was found that in the dataset 2 values were missing from the **english_sentence** feature which was encountered by treating with **Logical NOT**.

- Then through **exploratory data analysis** it was found that 
  - Most of the datapoints have have **<50 words**.
  - Sentences with **word count>=100** are very less and hencem they can be avoided.
  - The **highest length** of an **hindi sentence** is found under the class name **indic2012** for **source**.
  - The **lowest length** of a hindi sentence is found under the class name **ted** for **source**.
  - Hence, only **ted** was for the **source**. 
  
- After that certain data post processing operations were performed such as **genarating new features**, **feature encoding** and **feature extraction**

- After that the **encoder-decoder architecture** was defined keeping **latent_dim =300**.

 <br>
 
 - In the architecture one **embedding encoder layer** was defined followed by an **encoder lstm** layer.
 
 - The final dense layer was made of output shape **(None,None,17541)**.
 
 - The total **trainable parameters** were found to be **16,193,541**.

 <br>

- After that the model was trained on **30 epochs** and a batch size of **128** and on the final validation loss we recived a loss of **2.74**

- After that the **decoder layer** was made which would **take up the encoded sequence as the input and decode the sentence as output.**


- After that **predictions** were made for a given datapoint. Example of a prediction is as shown in the following figure.

# **4. Libraries Used**

Following are the list of **libraries** that were used for making this project.

- **Tensorflow** and **Keras** were used in order to make the model architecture, training and testing.  
- **numpy** was used in order to calcucate numercal operations.
- **pandas** was used to make the dataframes, profiling and processing the data.
- **Pyplot** was used to render out vizualizations in order to draw insights.
-  **Scikit Learn** was used to split the data into training and testing datasets.

# **5. Summary**

- We had successfully built this **encoder-decoder** model that can convert **english text to hindi text.**

- As the **number of epochs increase** so does the **accuracy** and hence, **loss gets reduced.**

- This model was trained on **30 epochs**, however, training this model with more number of epochs can bring up better results.

- Future scope of work would be to apply **transformer layer** on top of encoder-decoder architecture and hence, it is expected that it will return **lesser training loss**.
